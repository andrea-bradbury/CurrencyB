# Currency B 
Work In Progress


...
Mobile Apps Class Project: 
 A simple app to exchange coins and convert to 3 select currencies.
This portfolio exercise covers:
 Web APIs
 Asynchronous methods
 Runtime error checking 

Using https://exchangeratesapi.io/ Web API.


...
Testing
Test that the app fails gracefully under the following scenarios...
1. If there is no internet connection.
2. If you make a mistake in the URL. (Say, https://api.exchngeratesapi.io/...) This is the same
thing that would happen if the website moved.
3. If you make a mistake in the API call. (Say “https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/blargle”) This is
the same thing that would happen if the API changed.
4. If you enter an invalid currency. (Say, US instead of USD.)
